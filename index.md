(pronunciation guide: /ˈkaɕa/[wiki][kasia-pronounce])

I am a population geneticist by training, with expertise in data analysis and algorithm development in human genetics.

From March 2014 to June 2023 I wore many hats on the Research, Product, and R&D teams
at [23andMe][23andme]. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical
School][harvard-genetics] with [David Reich][reich]. I
received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in [Biometry][cornell-biometry] at Cornell under [Carlos
Bustamante][bustamante] and a B.A. from Stanford in [M&CS][stanford-mcs].
