Katarzyna "Kasia" Bryc
(pronunciation guide: /ˈkaɕa/[wiki][kasia-pronounce])


I am a population geneticist interested in human anthropological genetics, especially in 
the context of thinking about ancient human history and migrations, recent population 
admixture and other unknown forces shaping the human genome.

Since March 2014, I have been a part of the [Research Team][23andme-research] at 
[23andMe][23andme]. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical 
School with [David Reich][reich] in the [Department of Genetics][harvard-genetics]. 
I have a PhD from Cornell University in the [Bustamante Lab][bustamante] (now found at 
Stanford).

My background is in Mathematics and Statistics (more specifically, [M&CS][stanford-mcs] 
and [Biometry][cornell-biometry]). Statistics drives discoveries to complex problems 
arising from the awesome flood of genetic data.
