(pronunciation guide: /ˈkaɕa/[wiki][kasia-pronounce])

I am a statistical geneticist, with deep expertise in population genetics, data analysis and algorithm development, and a commitment to leveraging genetic diversity in research with the aim of reducing health disparities.

I have been the recipient of an NIH [SBIR Phase I grant][sbir], and an NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award, and developed numerous algorithms as products and patent applications. I build teams and drive interdisciplinary collaboration; I have developed research surveys and optimized data collection, and worked closely with partners in Engineering, Design, Communications, and Marketing to launch impactful products. I am an advocate for diversity in all stages of research and product development. 

From March 2014 to June 2023 I worked on the Research, Product, and R&D teams
at [23andMe][23andme]. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical
School][harvard-genetics] with [David Reich][reich]. I
received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in [Biometry][cornell-biometry] at Cornell under [Carlos
Bustamante][bustamante] and a B.A. from Stanford in [M&CS][stanford-mcs].
