(pronunciation guide: /ˈkaɕa/[wiki][kasia-pronounce])

I am a population geneticist interested in human anthropological genetics, especially in
the context of thinking about ancient human history and migrations, recent population
admixture and other unknown forces shaping the human genome.

Since March 2014, I have been a part of the [Research Team][23andme-research] at
[23andMe][23andme]. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical
School with [David Reich][reich] in the [Department of Genetics][harvard-genetics]. I
received a M.S. and Ph.D. in [Biometry][cornell-biometry] at Cornell under [Carlos
Bustamante][bustamante], and a B.A. from Stanford in [M&CS][stanford-mcs].
