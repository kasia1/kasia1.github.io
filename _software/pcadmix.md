    **PCAdmix** is a software package designed to infer local ancestry along the genome
    of an admixed individual using genotyping data. High confidence assessment of local
    ancestry along the genome in admixed individuals is critical for applications such
    as basic ancestry inference and admixture mapping of traits for disease variants.
    First published as a two-way method [paper](/assets/static/Bryc2010.pdf), it is now
    extended to three or more populations using phased data (Brisbin et al. 2012)
