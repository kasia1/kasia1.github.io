My research nestles around several general themes:

<div class="title">Population Genetics as a lens for understanding genetic variation</div>
Genetic data traces human history, both ancient and recent. In many cases, genetics
mirrors geography, like [in Africa][africa] and [in Europe][europe]. Genetics can sometimes cleanly separate
continental and subcontinental populations [world-wide][worldwide]. Other times it reflects subtle
population history differences, such as [in Latinos][latinos]. These genetic differences can be
[interrogated][admixture_grant] to yield insights into medically-relevant genetic variants.

<div class="title">Everyone is admixed</div>
The more we explore, the more we see the prevalence of gene flow between populations
involved in shaping nearly all of human evolution. In my research, I have developed methods for estimating local ancestry
resulting from recent admixture ([PCAdmix](/software/)), and methods to provide insights into
an individual's own [genealogical admixture history][ancestry_timeline].

<div class="title">Extracting signals from data leveraging statistics</div>
I have used iterative methods ([HetEM](/software/)) for inference of challenging population genetic parameters,
applied clustering algorithms for detecting [genetic groups][genetic_groups],
and advanced mathematical theory in the interpretation of [Principal Component Analysis][pca_paper] of genetic data.
