            Estimating the genomic location and length of identical-by-descent (IBD) segments among individuals is a crucial step in many genetic analyses. However, the exponential growth in the size of biobank and direct-to-consumer genetic data sets makes accurate IBD inference a significant computational challenge. Here we present the templated positional Burrows–Wheeler transform (TPBWT) to make fast IBD estimates robust to genotype and phasing errors. Using haplotype data simulated over pedigrees with realistic genotyping and phasing errors, we show that the TPBWT outperforms other state-of-the-art IBD inference algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy. For each phase-aware method, we explore the false positive and false negative rates of inferring IBD by segment length and characterize the types of error commonly found. Our results highlight the fragility of most phased IBD inference methods; the accuracy of IBD estimates can be highly sensitive to the quality of haplotype phasing. Additionally, we compare the performance of the TPBWT against a widely used phase-free IBD inference approach that is robust to phasing errors. We introduce both in-sample and out-of-sample TPBWT-based IBD inference algorithms and demonstrate their computational efficiency on massive-scale data sets with millions of samples. Furthermore, we describe the binary file format for TPBWT-compressed haplotypes that results in fast and efficient out-of-sample IBD computes against very large cohort panels. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the TPBWT in a brief empirical analysis, exploring geographic patterns of haplotype sharing within Mexico. Hierarchical clustering of IBD shared across regions within Mexico reveals geographically structured haplotype sharing and a strong signal of isolation by distance. Our software implementation of the TPBWT is freely available for noncommercial use in the code repository (https://github.com/23andMe/phasedibd, last accessed January 11, 2021).

        abstract: |
            According to historical records of transatlantic slavery, traders forcibly deported an estimated 12.5 million people from ports along the Atlantic coastline of Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries, with global impacts reaching to the present day, more than a century and a half after slavery’s abolition. Such records have fueled a broad understanding of the forced migration from Africa to the Americas yet remain underexplored in concert with genetic data. Here, we analyzed genotype array data from 50,281 research participants, which—combined with historical shipping documents—illustrate that the current genetic landscape of the Americas is largely concordant with expectations derived from documentation of slave voyages. For instance, genetic connections between people in slave trading regions of Africa and disembarkation regions of the Americas generally mirror the proportion of individuals forcibly moved between those regions. While some discordances can be explained by additional records of deportations within the Americas, other discordances yield insights into variable survival rates and timing of arrival of enslaved people from specific regions of Africa. Furthermore, the greater contribution of African women to the gene pool compared to African men varies across the Americas, consistent with literature documenting regional differences in slavery practices. This investigation of the transatlantic slave trade, which is broad in scope in terms of both datasets and analyses, establishes genetic links between individuals in the Americas and populations across Atlantic Africa, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of the African roots of peoples of the Americas.

            Over the past 500 years, North America has been the site of ongoing mixing of Native Americans, European settlers, and Africans
            (brought largely by the trans-Atlantic slave trade), shaping the early history of what became the United States. We studied the genetic
            ancestry of 5,269 self-described African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans who are 23andMe customers and
            show that the legacy of these historical interactions is visible in the genetic ancestry of present-day Americans. We document pervasive
            mixed ancestry and asymmetrical male and female ancestry contributions in all groups studied. We show that regional ancestry differences
            reflect historical events, such as early Spanish colonization, waves of immigration from many regions of Europe, and forced relocation
            of Native Americans within the US. This study sheds light on the fine-scale differences in ancestry within and across the United
            States and informs our understanding of the relationship between racial and ethnic identities and genetic ancestry.

            High-throughput shotgun sequence data make it possible in principle to
            accurately estimate population genetic parameters without confounding by SNP
            ascertainment bias. One such statistic of interest is the proportion of
            heterozygous sites within an individual’s genome, which is informative about
            inbreeding and effective population size. However, in many cases, the
            available sequence data of an individual are limited to low coverage,
            preventing the confident calling of genotypes necessary to directly count the
            proportion of heterozygous sites. Here, we present a method for estimating an
            individual’s genome-wide rate of heterozygosity from low-coverage sequence
            data, without an intermediate step that calls genotypes. Our method jointly
            learns the shared allele distribution between the individual and a panel of
            other individuals, together with the sequencing error distributions and the
            reference bias. We show our method works well, first, by its performance on
            simulated sequence data and, second, on real sequence data where we obtain
            estimates using low-coverage data consistent with those from higher coverage.
            We apply our method to obtain estimates of the rate of heterozygosity for 11
            humans from diverse worldwide populations and through this analysis reveal the
            complex dependency of local sequencing coverage on the true underlying
            heterozygosity, which complicates the estimation of heterozygosity from
            sequence data. We show how we can use filters to correct for the confounding
            arising from sequencing depth. We find in practice that ratios of
            heterozygosity are more interpretable than absolute estimates and show that we
            obtain excellent conformity of ratios of heterozygosity with previous
            estimates from higher-coverage data.

            Identifying ancestry along each chromosome in admixed individuals provides a
            wealth of information for understanding the population genetic history of
            admixture events and is valuable for admixture mapping and identifying recent
            targets of selection. We present
            [PCAdmix](http://sites.google.com/site/pcadmix/home), a Principal
            Components-based algorithm for determining ancestry along each chromosome from
            a high-density, genome-wide set of phased single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
            genotypes of admixed individuals. We compare our method to HAPMIX on simulated
            data from two ancestral populations, and we find high concordance between the
            methods. Our method also has better accuracy than LAMP when applied to
            three-population admixture, a situation as yet unaddressed by HAPMIX. Finally,
            we apply our method to a data set of four Latino populations with European,
            African, and Native American ancestry. We find evidence of assortative mating
            in each of the four populations, and we identify regions of shared ancestry
            that may be recent targets of selection and could serve as candidate regions
            for admixture-based association mapping.

            Full sequencing of individual human genomes has greatly expanded our
            understanding of human genetic variation and population history. Here, we
            present a systematic analysis of 50 human genomes from 11 diverse global
            populations sequenced at high coverage. Our sample includes 12 individuals who
            have admixed ancestry and who have varying degrees of recent (within the last
            500 years) African, Native American, and European ancestry. We found over 21
            million single-nucleotide variants that contribute to a 1.75-fold range in
            nucleotide heterozygosity across diverse human genomes. This heterozygosity
            ranged from a high of one heterozygous site per kilobase in west African
            genomes to a low of 0.57 heterozygous sites per kilobase in segments inferred
            to have diploid Native American ancestry from the genomes of Mexican and
            Puerto Rican individuals. We show evidence of all three continental ancestries
            in the genomes of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and African American populations, and
            the genome-wide statistics are highly consistent across individuals from a
            population once ancestry proportions have been accounted for. Using a
            generalized linear model, we identified subtle variations across populations
            in the proportion of neutral versus deleterious variation and found that
            genome-wide statistics vary in admixed populations even once ancestry
            proportions have been factored in. We further infer that multiple periods of
            gene flow shaped the diversity of admixed populations in the Americas-70% of
            the European ancestry in today’s African Americans dates back to European gene
            flow happening only 7-8 generations ago.

            We present a DNA library preparation method that has allowed us to reconstruct
            a high-coverage (30×) genome sequence of a Denisovan, an extinct relative of
            Neandertals. The quality of this genome allows a direct estimation of
            Denisovan heterozygosity indicating that genetic diversity in these archaic
            hominins was extremely low. It also allows tentative dating of the specimen on
            the basis of “missing evolution” in its genome, detailed measurements of
            Denisovan and Neandertal admixture into present-day human populations, and the
            generation of a near-complete catalog of genetic changes that swept to high
            frequency in modern humans since their divergence from Denisovans.

            Inferring population structure using bayesian clustering programs often
            requires a priori specification of the number of subpopulations, K, from which
            the sample has been drawn. Here, we explore the utility of a common bayesian
            model selection criterion, the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), for
            estimating K. We evaluate the accuracy of DIC, as well as other popular
            approaches, on datasets generated by coalescent simulations under various
            demographic scenarios. We find that DIC outperforms competing methods in many
            genetic contexts, validating its application in assessing population structure.

            Understanding the contribution of rare and common genetic variants to disease
            susceptibility will probably require multi- and trans- ethnic sequencing
            studies that compare the genomes of many individuals with and without a
            particular disease. Accounting for the role of population stratification at
            fine scales, both in terms of genomic and geographic location, will be
            important because rare alleles are likely to show more population
            stratification. Here, we present results from sequencing, assembly and genomic
            analysis of two genomes from the Phase 3 HapMap. The donor individuals are of
            Mexican and African ancestry and represent the first 'admixed' genomes to be
            sequenced to high coverage.

        abstract: |
            Hispanic/Latino populations possess a complex genetic structure that reflects
            recent admixture among and potentially ancient substructure within Native
            American, European, and West African source populations. Here, we quantify
            genome-wide patterns of SNP and haplotype variation among 100 individuals with
            ancestry from Ecuador, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic
            genotyped on the Illumina 610-Quad arrays and 112 Mexicans genotyped on
            Affymetrix 500K platform. Intersecting these data with previously collected
            high-density SNP data from 4,305 individuals, we use principal component
            analysis and clustering methods FRAPPE and STRUCTURE to investigate
            genome-wide patterns of African, European, and Native American population
            structure within and among Hispanic/Latino populations. Comparing autosomal, X
            and Y chromosome, and mtDNA variation, we find evidence of a significant sex
            bias in admixture proportions consistent with disproportionate contribution of
            European male and Native American female ancestry to present-day populations.
            We also find that patterns of linkage-disequilibria in admixed Hispanic/Latino
            populations are largely affected by the admixture dynamics of the populations,
            with faster decay of LD in populations of higher African ancestry. Finally,
            using the locus-specific ancestry inference method LAMP, we reconstruct
            fine-scale chromosomal patterns of admixture. We document moderate power to
            differentiate among potential subcontinental source populations within the
            Native American, European, and African segments of the admixed Hispanic/Latino
            genomes. Our results suggest future genome-wide association scans in
            Hispanic/Latino populations may require correction for local genomic ancestry
            at a subcontinental scale when associating differences in the genome with
            disease risk, progression, and drug efficacy, as well as for admixture mapping.

            Advances in genome technology have facilitated a new understanding of the
            historical and genetic processes crucial to rapid phenotypic evolution under
            domestication. To understand the process of dog diversification better, we
            conducted an extensive genome-wide survey of more than 48,000 single
            nucleotide polymorphisms in dogs and their wild progenitor, the grey wolf.
            Here we show that dog breeds share a higher proportion of multi-locus
            haplotypes unique to grey wolves from the Middle East, indicating that they
            are a dominant source of genetic diversity for dogs rather than wolves from
            east Asia, as suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Furthermore, we
            find a surprising correspondence between genetic and phenotypic/functional
            breed groupings but there are exceptions that suggest phenotypic
            diversification depended in part on the repeated crossing of individuals with
            novel phenotypes. Our results show that Middle Eastern wolves were a critical
            source of genome diversity, although interbreeding with local wolf populations
            clearly occurred elsewhere in the early history of specific lineages. More
            recently, the evolution of modern dog breeds seems to have been an iterative
            process that drew on a limited genetic toolkit to create remarkable phenotypic
            diversity.

            Quantifying patterns of population structure in Africans and African Americans
            illuminates the history of human populations and is critical for undertaking
            medical genomic studies on a global scale. To obtain a fine-scale genome-wide
            perspective of ancestry, we analyze Affymetrix GeneChip 500K genotype data
            from African Americans (n = 365) and individuals with ancestry from West
            Africa (n = 203 from 12 populations) and Europe (n = 400 from 42 countries).
            We find that population structure within the West African sample reflects
            primarily language and secondarily geographical distance, echoing the Bantu
            expansion. Among African Americans, analysis of genomic admixture by a
            principal component-based approach indicates that the median proportion of
            European ancestry is 18.5% (25th–75th percentiles: 11.6–27.7%), with very
            large variation among individuals. In the African-American sample as a whole,
            few autosomal regions showed exceptionally high or low mean African ancestry,
            but the X chromosome showed elevated levels of African ancestry, consistent
            with a sex-biased pattern of gene flow with an excess of European male and
            African female ancestry. We also find that genomic profiles of individual
            African Americans afford personalized ancestry reconstructions differentiating
            ancient vs. recent European and African ancestry. Finally, patterns of genetic
            similarity among inferred African segments of African-American genomes and
            genomes of contemporary African populations included in this study suggest
            African ancestry is most similar to non-Bantu Niger-Kordofanian-speaking
            populations, consistent with historical documents of the African Diaspora and
            trans-Atlantic slave trade.

            Characterizing patterns of genetic variation within and among human
            populations is important for understanding human evolutionary history and for
            careful design of medical genetic studies. Here, we analyze patterns of
            variation across 443,434 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in
            3845 individuals from four continental regions. This unique resource allows us
            to illuminate patterns of diversity in previously under-studied populations at
            the genome-wide scale including Latin America, South Asia, and Southern
            Europe. Key insights afforded by our analysis include quantifying the degree
            of admixture in a large collection of individuals from Guadalajara, Mexico;
            identifying language and geography as key determinants of population structure
            within India; and elucidating a north–south gradient in haplotype diversity
            within Europe. We also present a novel method for identifying long-range
            tracts of homozygosity indicative of recent common ancestry. Application of
            our approach suggests great variation within and among populations in the
            extent of homozygosity, suggesting both demographic history (such as
            population bottlenecks) and recent ancestry events (such as consanguinity)
            play an important role in patterning variation in large modern human
            populations.

            The imprints of domestication and breed development on the genomes of
            livestock likely differ from those of companion animals. A deep draft sequence
            assembly of shotgun reads from a single Hereford female and comparative
            sequences sampled from six additional breeds were used to develop probes to
            interrogate 37,470 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 497 cattle from
            19 geographically and biologically diverse breeds. These data show that cattle
            have undergone a rapid recent decrease in effective population size from a
            very large ancestral population, possibly due to bottlenecks associated with
            domestication, selection, and breed formation. Domestication and artificial
            selection appear to have left detectable signatures of selection within the
            cattle genome, yet the current levels of diversity within breeds are at least
            as great as exists within humans.

            Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental
            interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in
            high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding
            of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use
            large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we
            characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals
            genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome.
            Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find
            a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a
            geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional
            summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when
            mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can
            arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the
            results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing6; an
            individual’s DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising
            accuracy—often to within a few hundred kilometres.

            Technological and scientific advances, stemming in large part from the Human
            Genome and HapMap projects, have made large-scale, genome-wide investigations
            feasible and cost effective. These advances have the potential to dramatically
            impact drug discovery and development by identifying genetic factors that
            contribute to variation in disease risk as well as drug pharmacokinetics,
            treatment efficacy, and adverse drug reactions. In spite of the technological
            advancements, successful application in biomedical research would be limited
            without access to suitable sample collections. To facilitate exploratory
            genetics research, we have assembled a DNA resource from a large number of
            subjects participating in multiple studies throughout the world. This growing
            resource was initially genotyped with a commercially available genome-wide
            500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism panel. This project includes nearly
            6,000 subjects of African-American, East Asian, South Asian, Mexican, and
            European origin. Seven informative axes of variation identified via
            principal-component analysis (PCA) of these data confirm the overall integrity
            of the data and highlight important features of the genetic structure of
            diverse populations. The potential value of such extensively genotyped
            collections is illustrated by selection of genetically matched population
            controls in a genome-wide analysis of abacavir-associated hypersensitivity
            reaction. We find that matching based on country of origin, identity-by-state
            distance, and multidimensional PCA do similarly well to control the type I
            error rate. The genotype and demographic data from this reference sample are
            freely available through the NCBI database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).
