Some general themes that my research is nestled around:

<div class="title">Genetics as a tool for understanding history</div>
Genetic data traces human history, both ancient and recent. In many cases, genetics
mirrors geography [in Africa][africa] [in Europe][europe]. Genetics can sometimes cleanly separate
continental and subcontinental populations [world-wide][worldwide]. Other times it reflects subtle
population history differences [in Latinos][latinos].

<div class="title">Everyone is admixed</div>
The more we explore, the more we see the prevalence of gene flow between populations
involved in shaping nearly all of human evolution, which is less linear than textbook
timelines like to show. In my research, I develop methods for estimating local ancestry
resulting from recent admixture ([PCAdmix](/software/)) and study the complex history of
many modern populations that reflect the impact of post-Columbian intercontinental
migrations.

<div class="title">Extracting signals from data leveraging statistics</div>
One of the biggest puzzles faced by researchers today is how to make sense of the egads of
genetic data available. Luckily, statistics loves doing the heavy lifting necessary to
extract signals from noise, and make inferences of estimates we are interested in, such as
heterozygosity from low coverage sequence data ([HetEM](/software/)).
