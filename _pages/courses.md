<div class="title">(Almost) Everything You Need To Know About Statistical Genetics</div>
An intense series of influential topics covered in ~3 hour discussion sessions. Fall 2011.

Taken almost verbatim, from the course BTRY 482/682 taught by Carlos Bustamante at Cornell
University. All errors, of course, are mine.
