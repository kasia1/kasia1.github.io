**HeterozygosityEM** is an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimating genome-wide 
heterozygosity from sequence data. Method forthcoming (soon!).

title: PCAdmix
---
**PCAdmix** is a software package designed to infer local ancestry along the genome of an 
admixed individual using genotyping data. High confidence assessment of local ancestry 
along the genome in admixed individuals is critical for applications such as basic 
ancestry inference and admixture mapping of traits for disease variants. First published 
as a two-way method [paper](/assets/static/Bryc2010.pdf), it is now extended to three or 
more populations using phased data (Brisbin et al. 2012)
